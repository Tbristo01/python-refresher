# There are three main types of numbers in Python: Int,float and complex 

# Integers - The integer data type is comprised of all the positive and negative whole numbers.

print(10)  # A positive integer
print(-3000)  # A negative integer

num = 123456789  # Assigning an integer to a variable
print(num)
num = -16000  # Assigning a new integer
print(num)


# Floating Point Numbers
# Floating-point numbers, or floats, refer to positive and negative decimal numbers.

print(1.00000000005)  # A positive float
print(-85.6701)  # A negative float

flt_pt = 1.23456789
print(flt_pt)

# Complex Numbers
# It requires two values. The first one will be the real part of the complex number, while the second value will be the imaginary part.
print(complex(10, 20))  # Represents the complex number (10 + 20j)
print(complex(2.5, -18.2))  # Represents the complex number (2.5 - 18.2j)

complex_1 = complex(0, 2)
complex_2 = complex(2, 0)
print(complex_1)
print(complex_2)
